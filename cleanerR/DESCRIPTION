Description: This Package was made to handle missing data
    It is based on the concept of almost functional dependencies to fill mising data,as well as help you see what data is missing.
    The user can specify a measure of error and how many combinations he wish to test the dependencies against, the closer to the length of the dataset, the more precise
    But the higher the number the more time it will take for the process to finish
    If the program cannot predict with the accuracy determined by the user it shall not fill the data, the user then can choose to increase the error or deal with the data another way
